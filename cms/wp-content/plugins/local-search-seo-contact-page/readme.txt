Local Search SEO Contact Page displays business information and also adds a QR code, hCard/vCard, Google map, geo-tag, social media buttons, and more.

2. Log into WordPress and go to Plugins.
3. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
4. Open the plugin configuration page, which is located under Settings -> SEO Contact Page.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= I installed and activated the plugin, now what? =

Go to Settings, SEO Contact Page. Configure these settings and save them. Copy the shortcodes you need from the Settings and paste them onto your contact page.

= The full contact page shortcode layout does not look right. How can I fix it? =

We recommend using the full shortcode on sites at least 500 pixels wide (not including sidebars). If your layout is not wide enough, just use the individual shortcodes to create a layout of your own using tables or div tags.

= Why is my Google map not showing up right? =

There can be a few reasons. Make sure your address is accurate. Leaving the &quot;Business name on the map&quot; section blank may also help if your business name is not registered in Google Places.

= How can I change my QR Code? =

Under the Settings in the Dashboard, put something into the custom QR space. You can use a link, email, telephone, geo-code, or more.

= My social media button does not work, how can I fix it? =

Those buttons are based entirely on what URL you put into the Settings. Check the URL again and paste it into a browser manually to make sure it goes to the right place.

= My Google Map always breaks or disappears. Will this plugin fix it? =

Yes, our Wordpress Google Map Plugin shortcode will display the map and it will not get broken by the Wordpress auto-formatting no matter how many times you edit the page or switch from normal to html view. Just put your address and location (latitude, longitude) in the settings page and paste the map using the shortcode. You can use the entire contact page shortcode or just the map only.
